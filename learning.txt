NOTATION: 
    <command>: run command in terminal

--------------------------------Installation process-----------------------------
<node --version>
<npx --version>

<mkdir FullStackWeb3>
<cd FullStackWeb3>
<npx hardhat --init>
    Version: “Hardhat 3 Beta”
    Directory: current directory (".")
    Project type: “A minimal Hardhat project” not default
    Install dependencies: yes

Hardhat Pluggins:
<npm add --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition viem>

in hardhat.config.ts file:
    import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem";
    inside defineConfig add pluggins:[hardhatToolboxViemPlugin]

----------------------Compilation-----------------------
now write solidity code in contracts folder
for compilation: <npx hardhat build>
--------------------------------------------------------

------------------------Testing-------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------

------------------------Deployment----------------------
A. Using Ignition:
    1. create a ignition folder & inside it a modules folder and inside it Chai.ts file 
    2. Write code inside it (for more detail see that file)
    3.  (a) For deploying to local hardhat network: 
                <npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts>

        (b) For deploying to local development node:
                run <npx hardhat node> in one terminal  
                    --it starts a local blockchain
                    --Runs at: http://127.0.0.1:8545
                    --provide 20 fre funded accounts
                run <npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Chai.ts --network localhost> in another terminal
                    --network localhost means Hardhat connects to: http://127.0.0.1:8545
                Deployment happens on your local blockchain
                NOT on in-memory Hardhat network
                NOT on testnet or mainnet
                * if we run this command again it does not deploy & Prevents duplicate deployments *

        (c) For deploying to live network:
                Add this in hard.config.ts file inside define config: 
                    networks: {
                        sepolia: {
                            type: "http",
                            url: "<SEPOLIA_RPC_URL>",
                            accounts: ["<SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY>"],
                        },
                    },
                run <npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts --network sepolia> in terminal

    4. WHAT IS IGNITION:
        Instead of:
            manually writing deployment scripts
            worrying about order, failures, retries
            We describe what we want, and Ignition figures out how to do it safely.
            This is why it’s called declarative.    
            in old way(using scripts) we tell how to do everything. this is called as imperative
        Ignition way (declarative)
            We tell what should exist.
            “I want this contract deployed, and then this function called.”

    5. WHAT IS IGNITION MODULE(eg our Chai.ts file):
        it is just a blueprint that describes which contracts should exist, which functions should be called
        it doesnt deploy anything by itself
        it is deployment intruction written in code

    6 WHAT IS DIFFERENCE IN OLD WAY AND IGNITION WAY:
        OLD WAY(WRITING SCRIPTS):
        What happens at runtime:
            Node.js starts executing the script
            JS reaches deploy()
            Transaction is sent immediately
            Next line executes
            👉 Our script is directly driving blockchain actions
            If script crashes:
                Deployment stops
                No memory
                You must restart manually
        
        IGNITION WAY:
        👉 Ignition engine control execution
        example code: const counter = m.contract("Counter");
        What happens at runtime:
            Node.js executes this line
            m.contract() does NOT deploy
            It only records an instruction:
            “Later, deploy Counter”
            No transaction is sent.

        What happens step by step:
            1. it execute line by line
            2. Each m.contract, m.call registers instructions
            3. when execution of that code finishes, Ignition engine now has a graph of steps
            4. Ignition decides:
                order,retries,parallelism
            5. Ignition sends blockchain transactions
        Blockchain interation happens after js complete execution

-------------------------------------ABI ENCODING---------------------------------------

The Ethereum machine (EVM) does not understand function names like: f(5)

It only understands bytes.
So before calling a function using .call(), we must:
Convert “call function with arguments” into bytes
That conversion is called ABI encoding.

Two methods:

1️⃣ abi.encodeWithSignature (OLD, manual way)
    abi.encodeWithSignature("f(uint256)", 5)

    What we are doing
    we are telling Solidity manually:
        “Please call a function named f that takes a uint256, and pass 5.”

    Why this is risky
    Because Solidity does not check your string.
    If you make a mistake:
    abi.encodeWithSignature("f(uint)", 5)  // ❌ wrong

    It still compiles, but:
    Function may not run
    Or wrong function may be called
    Hard to debug

2️⃣ abi.encodeCall (NEW, safe way)
    abi.encodeCall(Receiver.f, (5))

    What you are doing
    You are telling Solidity:
    “Use the actual function f from the Receiver contract.”

    Solidity now:
    Checks function exists
    Checks parameter types
    Protects you from mistakes
    You cannot accidentally pass wrong types.

ABI file & bytecode of contract is in artifacts/contracts/Chai.sol/chai.json
